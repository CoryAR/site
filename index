                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <span>My name is Cory Roberts, I have been using the web for more than two decades. I started using the web primarily to play games and trade TCG cards online. I eventually stumbled upon a message board service known as "InvisionFree" and that is where I started my web development journey. I was always fascinated by what you can do with a few lines of code. I gradually started learning HTML and CSS to build the basics of webpages. Later on, I started becoming aquainted with JavaScript & jQuery, and this is where my passion comes in.</span>

                <h3>What can I do?</h3>
                <span>I can build webpages for you with a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I dedicate myself to the front-end aspect of web building at this time and not necessarily the back-end or web design. I can build the layout and structure of pages for you and add dynamic touches to them.</span>
